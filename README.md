<h1>FFXI Map Overhaul</h1>
<div>My approach was this: how do we replicate the original FFXI Atlas, but also add modern interactive features? Below is a summation of what I came up with so far. 
<br></br>

<br></br>
<h3>Desired Interactive Components</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>Zooming (World Map only): Requires multiple maps with varying degrees of complexity; should get more detailed as you zoom in closer to reveal more of the map</li>
  <li>Mouse hover over, with highlighting</li>
  <li>Controls for zoom (world map only), swapping to a world/zone map, and layers to turn on/off (ie: Nation Cities could be toggled to show banners or not, NMs, Home Point Crystals, etc)</li>
  <li>Custom links to wiki pages for anything</li>
</ul> 
<br></br>
<h3>Images from what is completed</h3>

<img src="/media/kuzotz_zoom.png" alt="world map">
<br></br>
<h3>Demo video</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Demo video shows a world map that I found Google. This is not what I plan to use permanently. The custom world maps shown above are the ones I built, so we won't be using other people's art. We can customize this as needed. </li>
  <l1>Zooming is limited because of the lack of detail on the current world map image. For context, the world map in the video only goes to zoom level 3, and I plan on doubling that, so it will get more and more detailed as you zoom in. Kuzotz is an example of actual artwork demonstrating this better.</l1>
  <li>Zone maps should be interactive. Links to the next zone should automatically open that map, for quick/easy tracking of where you intend to go. This same principle can apply to any link added to any map.</li>
  <li>When nearby a city, a city banner will be present on the map. This is meant to take you to a composite map of the city, where you can select which portion of the city to view. This is one of the last pieces to the project, and is now meant as a placeholder till I can get around to it.</li>
</ul>
